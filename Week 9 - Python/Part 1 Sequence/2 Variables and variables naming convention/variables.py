#A variable holds a value in a memory location that is needed
# for the execution of your program.
#A variable can only hold one value at a time. this value can change 
#throughout the execution of the program

# Variables must be declared before they can be used.
#declare and assign values to the respective vairables; num1, num2, num3
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
num3 = 30
answer1 = num1 + num1 
answer2 = num3 * num2
answer3 = answer1 + answer2

name1 = "John" # declare variable name1 and assign the value John
print("Welcome", name1) # Welcome John

name1 = "Peter" # re-declaring the value of name1 variable is now "Peter"
print("Welcome", name1) # Welcome Peter


print("This is the first answer:", answer1)

print("This is the seconds answer:", answer2)

print("This is the third answer:", answer3 )

# variable naming convention
username = "jsmsih" # use meaningful variable name
username1 = "paul125"
firstName = "Anna" # use camel notation:varaibles are case sensitive
firstname = "Jane" #  #not the same as varaible in line 33
last_name = "Wilson" # varaibles are case sensitive
last_Name = "Jameson" #not the same as varaible in line 35
userAge = 23
age = 24

#Avoid doing the following:
# £errr = "money"  don't use a symbol
# AGE = 12 variable name should not be in all upper cases
# Username = "toby345" # don't start variable names with upper case character
# 2username = "Coder112345" #dont start variable names with number
#user name = "test user" # no spaces between variable name/s



# Task 2 modify your programs written in task 1 
# Use variables instead of static value: for example 
# declare vairable and assign value to them as shown num1 = 2
# Exercise: use the print statement to print 
# Your name
# Your address
# Your interests
# Perform either addition or calculation with two numbers
# Use text in your addition 






# Variable naming convention
username = "user1"  # meaningful name
userName = (
    "user2"  # use of camel notation when the variable is a combination of two words
)
user_name = (
    "user3"  # use snake case/underscore when the variable is a combination of two words
)
user4 = "paul0045"  # meaningful name
userAge = 23  # meaningful name
firstname = "Anna"  # meaningful name and use of single quotes in value

"DON'T DO THIS"
AGE = 12  # Unless it is a constant!!
# £cash or $cash
User = "muser"  # dont start variable with upper case
# user name = # no spaces between two words in variable assignment
# 1user = "jam"# no number at start of variable name
