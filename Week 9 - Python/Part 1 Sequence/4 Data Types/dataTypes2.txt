# List An ordered sequence of items is called List. It is a very 
# flexible data type in Python. There is no need for the value in
#  the list to be of the same data type. The List is the data type 
# that is highly used data type in Python. List datatype is the 
# most exclusive datatype in Python for containing versatile data. 
# It can easily hold different types of data in Python.  list1 = 
#  [5,9.9,'list'] 



# Tuple:A Tuple is a sequence of items that are in order, 
# and it is not possible to modify the Tuples. 
# The main difference list and tuples are that tuple is immutable, 
# which means it cannot be altered. Tuples are generally faster 
# than the list data type in Python because it cannot be changed 
# or modified like list datatype. The primary use of Tuples is to 
# write-protect data. Tuples can be represented by using parentheses(), 
# and commas are used to separate the items. t = (6,’tuple’,4+2r)


# Set:  The Collection of Unique items that are not in order is called Set. 
# Braces {} are used to defined set and a comma is used to separate values. 
# One will find that the items are unordered in a set data type. 
# Duplicates are eliminated in a set and set only keeps unique values. 
# Operations like intersection and union can be performed on two sets.
# a = {4,5,5,6,6,6} The slicing operator does not work on set because the 
# set is not a collection of ordered items, and that is why there is no 
# meaning to the indexing of set



# Dictionary
# Dictionary is a type of python data type in which collections are unordered, 
# and values are in pairs called key-value pairs. This type of data type is useful 
# when there is a high volume of data. One of the best functions of Dictionaries 
# data type is retrieving the data for which it is optimized. The value can only 
# be retrieved if one knows the key to retrieve it.  Braces {} (curly brackets) 
# are used to define dictionaries data type in Python. A Pair in the dictionary 
# data type is an item which is represented as key:value. The value and the key 
# can be of any data type. Python Dictionary can look like this:
# dictionary1 = {3:’key’,4:’value’}
